Relweb ideas:
	have different projects, then under that have different categories/sections (and also containers which those can go under,) any of which can go under others.
	each category/section's scene can be freeform (place items anywhere) or chronological (arranged along a timeline axis.)
	
	items
		can have an optional title text, and any number of text descriptions, images, links, dates, files attachments, etc.
	connections
		lines which can have an optimal arrow in either direction, and which may be wavy or spirally, etc.
		optional text which is drawn along a connection, probably centered along the length of the line.
